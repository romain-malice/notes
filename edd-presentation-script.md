# Distribution Networks Basics

## Overview Of Electricity Delivery
%%
Power plant → transmission lines (HV) → distribution substations → distribution network (MV~1-10kV) → industries (MV)/local networks (LV~220V)
distribution network : set of nodes that generate or consume energy
%%

The basic structure of an electricity delivery network is the following :
1. Electricity is produced in power plants
2. Most power plants are relatively far from zones with a high density of users. Transmission lines are high voltage lines that convey electricity from the power plant to the high demand zones
3. Distribution substations turn the high voltages of the transmission lines into medium voltages (1-10kV), which are injected in distribution grids
4. Distribution grids give access to electricity directly to industries, or to homes and businesses, who are supplied through local distribution networks at lower voltages (220V)

## Goals of DNs
%%
power flow direction : 1 direction usually, 2 with solar generation
parameters to keep constant : V, I, f
%%

Give access to electricity to homes & businesses.
What we call a _stable_ grid is one that delivers a constant voltage at a constant frequency to all of its users.

# PV Integration

## Means
%%
chain : sun → energy to panels → DC current → AC current → into the grid
%%

Solar panels convert solar radiation into power.
Their generation can be modeled by[^1]
$$
p (t) = \eta \cdot S \cdot ir (t),
$$
where $\eta$ is the panels efficiency (typically 20 to 25%[^2]), $S$ is the total panel surface, and $ir(t)$ is the irradiance level in $\mathrm{Wm^{-2}}$.

The irradiance level is an unknown function of time, and is then responsible for the variations in the power output of the panels.

Solar panels produce a direct current, which needs to go through an inverter (electronic component), which turns it into alternative current.
This current is then fed through a transformer that increases its voltage, before penetrating the grid.
This whole process is called grid integration.[^3]

## Challenges
%%
Investigate :
- Voltage spikes
- Frequency fluctuations
- Bidirectional power flow

Concepts :
- Parameters of the grid must stay constant
- Island : when the grid doesn’t produce power but the PV system does
%%

The main problems associated with solar power generation are voltage and frequency stability.[^3]
Indeed, most solar panels are _distributed sources_, meaning that they inject power from the grid, instead of following the general scheme described earlier.

As seen previously, the power generated by PV penetrates the grid through AC voltages (weird expression?).
These voltages (power flows) interfere with the power flow controlled by the DSO, and can create uncertainties regarding the voltages and the frequency of the electricity distributed to the users.

ln the case of larger solar farms that would require longer energy transportation distances, transmission lines losses have to be taken into account.

Moreover, since the power generation of PV panels is not predictable, fitting the power generation to the grid needs would require constant adjusting of the parameters of the generation.

## Summary

- PV creates DC with photovoltaic effect, which goes through an inverter and a transformer before penetrating the grid
- PV generation is distributed, meaning that it injects power from the inside of the distribution network and is not necessarily controlled by the DSO (>< classic power plants)

- PV can interfere with power flows in the grid and affect the quality of the power delivered to nearby users
- PV, as other renewable sources, is inconsistent in its power delivery, which makes it hard to integrate without causing problems in the grid power quality

# EV Integration

## Means

Even though inductive charging has been discussed[^4], most electric vehicles are using conductive charging methods, meaning charging through a conductor.
Within this category, several regulations exist.
In Europe, EV charging techniques are classified within 4 categories called _modes_.

Modes 1, 2 and 3 use AC to transfer power to the vehicle, and the AC/DC conversion is handled by the vehicle.
Modes 1 and 2 are the charging methods that use 230V plugs, and are the slowest, with a charging capacity of max. 2.3 and 7.4 kW in single phase, respectively.
The main difference between modes 1 and 2 is the presence of a monitoring device, that ensures safety and avoids overloading.

Mode 3 uses a charging station that communicates with the vehicle in order to modulate the charging capacity.
This mode can operate at 11 or 22 kW.

Mode 4 uses DC, and is used for fast-charging mostly, with charging capacities from 50 to 175 kW (in 2019).
In this mode, the charging station takes care of the AC/DC conversion.[^5]

## Challenges

%%
Generation : if charging on off-peak hours, no problems, if on, increase in peak load demand
Transformers : exceeding of rated capacity

%%

As seen earlier, the charging of EVs pulls a significant load on the grid, and can cause several problems.
Among them, we can identify 3
