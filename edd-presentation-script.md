# Introduction

# Distribution Networks Basics

# PV Integration

## Means

## Challenges

Investigate :
- Voltage spikes
- Frequency fluctuations
- Bidirectional power flow

Concepts :
- Parameters of the grid must stay constant
- Island : when the grid doesnâ€™t produce power but the PV system does

# EV Integration

## Means

## Challenges

Investigate :
- Voltage fluctuations
- Decreased conductors lifespan 
- Increased energy losses
- Exceeding of transformers nominal load capacity
- Overloading
- Variations in frequency

# Impact of both PV & EV

- PV generation assists aligning with EV demand
- Positive impact on load of cables & transformers
- Better voltage profile with PV generation
- Mitigation of phase voltage drop

# Conclusion
