# Talbi et al. 2024

Litterature review on EVs and PV impacts in the grid, both individually and mixed together.

## Impact of PV Integration on Distribution Network

- Bi-directional power flow in the grid
- Frequency overshoot above limits (50.5~50.6 Hz)
- Worsens _short-circuit faults_

## Impact of EV Integration on Distribution Network

- Overloading due to connection of an excessive amount of EVs.
    Leads to higher currents, (=> lower conductors lifespan) and voltage fluctuations (=> increased energy losses).

## Combined effect on the Distribution Network

The effects of EV and PV seem to cancel each otherâ€¦

# Nwaigwe et al. 2019

PV generates DC current, which is turned into an AC current through an inverter, and then penetrates the grid.

Most distribution networks were designed for 1 way power flow, but PV creates power flows that can go 2 ways.
