# Discrete Time Systems

Most controllers use computers => are discrete in time.
They are used to simulate real-life systems, which are often continuous (e.g. ODEs), but can be discrete too (e.g. mortgage with repayement).
The first is modeled by a differential equation, and the second by a _difference equation_ 

> [!warning] We are talking about **time** discrete and continuous systems, so it is not about sampling values !
