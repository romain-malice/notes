Sub-brands
==========

Polo Ralph Lauren
-----------------

First menswear line. Actually not the whole brand. Made clothes in a lot
of styles including ivy, workwear, ...

In terms of quality, the garments can vary a lot, from meh to really
good. The tag is white or yellow text on a dark blue background. The
yellow one is more recent, but doesn\'t necessarly means lower quality.

There is a lot of volume available on the pre-owned market, and it is
hard to sum up the brand to a few characteristics.

-   For the basics, the prices are generally lower, as is the quality.
-   For the more timeless pieces like coats or blazers, it can vary more
    in price.

Ralph Lauren {#ralph-lauren-1}
------------

This is either garments from mainline stores or for outlet stores. The
difference between the 2 is hard to notice.

Polo Sports
-----------

It is mostly streetwear. The design and quality is not crazy, it is
generally better to look for older designs.

Purple Label
------------

Most premium line. Fits small. It is not really made to age well, it
rather uses expensive materials, so pre-owned items won\'t always look
best worn-in.

The retail prices are generally very expensive, and items are commoly
sold for 25-40% of it.

**Black label** is similar but a bit less expensive, so the guidelines
are the same.

RRL
---

Classic american clothes. Wilder designs, good too really good quality
in general.

Nice for elevated everyday staples. For example : you can find shirts
for about 100€, while they retail around 250€.

Polo Country
------------

The predecessor of RRL, ending in the 90s. These are good quality
clothes, however they released items under this name recently that are
mor Polo quality.

Lauren Ralph Lauren
-------------------

Womens line, ok quality, lots of types of clothes. At some point, Ralph
Lauren lost control of this line, and they started selling suits of bad
quality.

=\> to avoid.

Ralph Ralph Lauren
------------------

Not RRL. Womens clothes and men suits. The quality is quite bad overall.

Denim & Supply
--------------

Similar to RRL in design, but quality is below Polo, so don\'t mix them
up.
