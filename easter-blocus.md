# Planning

## Week 1

- Work 1h/day on each project, full focus
- Review theory of each course
    - Focus on the most important
    - Goal : everything reviewed by the end of the week
    - Look at the

## Week 2

Assess advancement in projects and course review, modify last week’s planning as needed.

# How to

> [!warning] Important
> The main idea here is to streamline the process : only do what is necessary.

## Theory Review

When reviewing lectures, read a few slides to get what topic is discussed, then note from memory the important concepts and formulae, using the slides as a help if needed.

Schedule these sessions preferably in the morning, to be as focused as possible.

For notes, focus on either listing concepts (birds eye view), formulae, or detailing a hard to understand concept.

## Exercises Review

Explain with a lot of details how to solve a harder exercise, taking external sources (slides, internet, …) to justify steps if needed.
Include variations from other exercises if they add an interesting/important to know trick (e.g. _if this component were there, we would have to start solving from this side instead of this other one_).

Write these complete answers only for important/harder exercises only.
